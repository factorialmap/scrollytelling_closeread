This allows us to observe trends over time, identify patterns, and hightlight any significant fluctuations or anomalies in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\nBy splitting the chart based on variable type, we can highlight how different kinds of data behave and interact within the dataset.\n\n\n\n\nNow, how to explain this chart?\n\n\n\n\nPCE(Personal Consumption Expenditures) represents the total value of goods and services consumed by individuals. It is a key indicator of consumer spending and is used to assess economic activity and inflation trends.\n\n\n\n\nPOP(Population of the United States) refers to the total number of people residing in the U.S. This variable is essential for per capital calculations and demographic analysis.\n\n\n\n\nPSAVERT(Personal Saving Rate) Indicates the percentage of disposable income that individuals save rather than spend. It reflects consumer financial behavior and economic confidence.\n\n\n\n\nUEMPMED(Median Duration of Unemployment) Measures the median number of weeks individuals remain unemployed. It helps assess the health of the labor market and the effectiveness of job placement effors.\n\n\n\n\nENEMPLOY(Unemployment Rate) represents the percentage of the labor force that is actively seeking but unable to find employment. It is a core indicator of economic performance and labor market conditions.\n\n\n\n\nHow neural nets works\n\n\n\n\nWhat is bond yiels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlighting\nZooming\nPanning\n\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotnine\n\nfrom plotnine import *\nfrom plotnine.data import economics_long\n\n(\nggplot(economics_long, aes(x = \"date\", y = \"value\"))\n+ geom_line()\n+ facet_wrap(\"variable\", scales='free_y')\n+ theme_bw()\n)"
