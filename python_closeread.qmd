Draw your readers attention with: @cr-features

::: {#cr-features}
1. Highlighting
2. Zooming
3. Panning
:::

The first step is load the library, enabling access to its full set of features for the tasks ahead. [@cr-plotnine]{highlight="1-5"}

The next step is loading a data frame with economic data, enabling us to explore patterns and relationships across various financial indicators. [@cr-plotnine]{highlight="6"}

We generate a plot to visualize the data, using dates on the x-axis and corresponding value on the y-axis. This allows us to observe trends over time, identify patterns, and hightlight any significant fluctuations or anomalies in the dataset. [@cr-plotnine]{highlight="9"}

By splitting the chart based on variable type, we can highlight how different kinds of data behave and interact within the dataset. [@cr-plotnine]{highlight="11"}

:::{#cr-plotnine}
```{python}
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import plotnine

from plotnine import *
from plotnine.data import economics_long

(
ggplot(economics_long, aes(x = "date", y = "value"))
+ geom_line()
+ facet_wrap("variable", scales='free_y')
+ theme_bw()
)
```

Now, how to explain this chart? [@cr-kpi]


PCE(Personal Consumption Expenditures) represents the total value of goods and services consumed by individuals. It is a key indicator of consumer spending and is used to assess economic activity and inflation trends. [@cr-kpi]{pan-to="60%,50%" scale-by="2"}

POP(Population of the United States) refers to the total number of people residing in the U.S. This variable is essential for per capital calculations and demographic analysis. [@cr-kpi]{pan-to="-20%,50%" scale-by="2"} 

PSAVERT(Personal Saving Rate) Indicates the percentage of disposable income that individuals save rather than spend. It reflects consumer financial behavior and economic confidence. [@cr-kpi]{pan-to="-80%,50%" scale-by="2"}

UEMPMED(Median Duration of Unemployment) Measures the median number of weeks individuals remain unemployed. It helps assess the health of the labor market and the effectiveness of job placement effors. [@cr-kpi]{pan-to="50%,-40%" scale-by="2"}

ENEMPLOY(Unemployment Rate) represents the percentage of the labor force that is actively seeking but unable to find employment. It is a core indicator of economic performance and labor market conditions. [@cr-kpi]{pan-to="-20%,-40%" scale-by="2"}
